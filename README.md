## What is a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript code instead of opening a webpage. You store it in your browser's bookmarks bar like any other bookmark, but when you click it, it executes code on whatever page you're currently viewing.

Bookmarklets can modify pages, extract data, or add functionality to your browser. They use `javascript:` URLs instead of regular `http://` or `https://` URLs.
